# DeepvsReal
This is my third-semester machine learning project. The project tells apart deepfake images from real ones.

I have used Google's TensorFlow Keras primarily for model training and other Python libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and pandas for Exploratory data analysis.

I got my dataset from Kaggle.

This project is all open for suggestions. 

Thanks for reading this far. :D
