# DeepvsReal
This is my third-semester machine learning project. The project tells apart deepfake images from real ones.

I have used Google's TensorFlow Keras primarily for model training and other Python libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and pandas for Exploratory data analysis.

I got my dataset from Kaggle which is ->[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images).

This project is all open for suggestions. 

Thanks for reading this far. :D
